  <h1>Lesson 3 - Basic Music Theory</h1>
  <p>In order to write music that doesn't sound like complete <em>garbagio</em> you are going to have to learn a bit about how music is composed.  This lesson focuses on the basics of Music theory.</p>
  <p>Your task is simple... go again to <a href="http://www.musictheory.net/lessons">musictheory.net</a> and complete the following basic music theory lessons. It might be a good idea to take notes, so you can reference them during the assignments.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Staff, Clefs and Ledgerlines</li>
    <li>Steps and Accidentals</li>
    <li>The Major Scale</li>
    <li>The Minor Scale</li>
    <li>Scale Degrees</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Enharmonics:</h2>
  <p>The way renoise handles notes with Sharps/Flats can be a little unintuitive. Go read <a href="http://www.musicreadingsavant.com/enharmonics-different-names-for-the-same-pitches/">this</a> article about Enharmonic notes.</p>
  <p>To complete the assignment you will need to use sharps and flats so this bit of information is going to be crucial: <strong>Renoise <em>only</em> shows Sharps.</strong> If you want to write a scale that has flats in it in the Renoise sequencer, you will have to figure out what the enharmonic sharp versions of those notes are (and if that sentence was confusing.. go read that blog post again)</p>
  <h2>circle of 5ths:</h2>
  <p>
    Last thing... the theoretically correct way of figuring out what sharps and flats are in a key is to count whole and half steps, as outlined in the lessons above.  There is, however, a shortcut that makes it quicker and easier to figure it out... <strong>the circle of 5ths</strong>

  <p>
    Check out the image above.  Starting at the top and circling around the diagram you can easily see how many sharps or flats are in each key.  SO, you can print this thing out and keep it handy, OR: you can just memorize the pattern (it's not that hard ;)).
  </p>
  <p>
    you should also notice, that as you add sharps (or flats!) they always get added in the same order:
    <ul>
      <li>Sharps: F C G D A E B</li>
      <li>Flats: B E A D G C F</li>
    </ul>
    Also notice that the order of the flats is the SAME as the sharps, but reversed... and that the order of the Keys on the circle follow the SAME PATTERN (but starting on a different note): => C G D A E B
