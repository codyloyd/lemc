  <h1>LESSON 2 - the keyboard.</h1>
  <h3>step one: the piano keyboard</h3>
  <p>go to this site: <a href="http://www.musictheory.net/exercises/keyboard">musictheory.net</a> and test your knowledge of the piano keyboard.</p>
  <p>if you need help, you can find a diagram <a href="http://www.piano-keyboard-guide.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/36-key-keyboard-chart.jpg">here</a></p>
  <h3>step two: the Renoise keyboard</h3>
  <p>the Renoise sequencer has all the notes of a piano keyboard mapped out to your computer keyboard like in the following diagram:</p>

  <p>Once you're fairly comfortable with the piano keyboard (musictheory.net as in, you can identify the notes with 95% accuracy or so) go ahead and experiment with putting notes into the renoise sequencer.  To do this you'll need to load up an instrument that plays notes (i.e. NOT drums).</p>
  <p>Instruments can be loaded just like the drum samples were.. find an instrument on the "instrument tab" and either double-click it or drag it up to the instrument list in the top right of the program window.</p>
  <h2>PROTIP:</h2>
  <p>The CAPS LOCK key enters a "Note-Off".  This does exactly what you think it does.. it turns off the currently playing note.  By default (and depending on the instrument that you select) notes that you enter will ring out until the next note, or indefinitely if there is no next note.  If you want the note to STOP ringing, then you will need to enter a "Note-off" into the sequence, right were you want the note to stop.</p>
