  <h1>Lesson 10 - PLUGINS</h1>
  <p>
    Not a ton of new info here... just a part of the program that you haven't really used before.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've shown you how to use plugins in class so all you need to do is get them loaded up and then play around with them a bit.
  </p>
  <p>
    To load the available plugins go to the public 'Userfiles/High School/loyd/musicapp/' folder and copy the entire 'vst' folder to your desktop. (you can just click and drag it over.) 
  </p>
  <p>In Renoise, press ctl+, (the control key and the comma key at the same time) to open up the 'Preferences' menu.  In that window the plugins are the last option on the list: "Plug/Misc"</p>
  <p>At the top of that page under VST Plugins there will be a "Browse" button.. click it and then find the VST folder you put on your desktop. (then click OK".  That should take a few moments to load.. but when it has you should be good to go.  You can find the plugins on the "plugin" tab like I showed you in class.</p>

  <p>Some of the plugins are easier to use than others... and some are generally a little nicer than others, so take a few minutes to play around with each of them... at least figure out how to load different presets.</p>
