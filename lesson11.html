  <h1>Lesson 11 - Form Part 2</h1>
  <p>
     We've already learned about form in our music, so this lesson will just be a quick reminder and a bit of an extension of the concepts we've already covered.
  </p>
  <p>Reminder: Form is "diagrammed" using letter names for each section. So, for example the first main section (after any introduction that might exist) should be called "A", the next section would be "B" and any time the material from those sections returns you would label THAT section with the appropriate letter name... so the form of an entire song might be something like this: <br>
  <strong>
    intro A B A C A outro
  </strong>
  </p>
  <p>We've discussed this concept before as well.. but in less depth.  Most songs have "nested forms"  which is to say, there are clear main sections in the music, but those main sections also have some amount of form within them.  SO: for example, in the form diagram above, the <strong>A</strong> section might have an internal form of <strong>a a b a</strong>.</p>
  <p>The point here is: Music relies on repetition.  Your favorite songs, whatever they are have lots of repeated things in them.</p>
 <p>Before moving on to the actual assignment, take 10-15 minutes to listen to 2-3 songs that you really like and write out the Form on a piece of paper.  Focus first on the main sections of the songs, but on at least one of them, see if you can identify any internal sections as well.</p>
