  <h1>Lesson 3 - Basic Music Theory</h1>
  <p>In order to write music that doesn't sound like complete <em>garbagio</em> you are going to have to learn a bit about how music is composed.  This lesson focuses on the basics of Music theory.</p>
  <p>Your task is simple... go again to <a href="http://www.musictheory.net/lessons">musictheory.net</a> and complete the following basic music theory lessons. It might be a good idea to take notes, so you can reference them during the assignments.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Staff, Clefs and Ledgerlines</li>
    <li>Steps and Accidentals</li>
    <li>The Major Scale</li>
    <li>The Minor Scale</li>
    <li>Scale Degrees</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>one more thing...</h3>
  <p>The way renoise handles notes with Sharps/Flats can be a little unintuitive. Go read <a href="http://www.musicreadingsavant.com/enharmonics-different-names-for-the-same-pitches/">this</a> article about Enharmonic notes.</p>
  <p>To complete the assignment you will need to use sharps and flats so this bit of information is going to be crucial: <strong>Renoise <em>only</em> shows Sharps.</strong> If you want to write a scale that has flats in it in the Renoise sequencer, you will have to figure out what the enharmonic sharp versions of those notes are (and if that sentence was confusing.. go read that blog post again)</p>
