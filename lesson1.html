  <h1>Lesson 1 - Using Renoise</h1>
  <p>This section of the course based on writing and composing electronic music is going to cover a variety of topics, but for the most part, it is all going to center around using the program <a href="http://renoise.com/">Renoise</a></p>
  <p>The program itself is not free, but it's demo version is (almost) fully featured.  The demo is what we will be using for this class.  I will show you how to find a copy of the demo that you will drag onto the Desktop of whatever computer you are using. Feel free to copy the demo onto a USB flash drive if you like.</p>
  <p>Your First Assignment is to watch this video, follow along, and create a simple drum beat (like the one in the vid).  The video will be easier to follow if you open it up in a new tab and watch it full-screen.</p>

  <p>When you've finished with your own short drum-beat, let me listen to it.</p>
