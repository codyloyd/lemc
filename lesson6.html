  <h1>Lesson 6 - Chords</h1>
  <p>
    Now that you've had practice working with scales (and learned a bit more about renoise üëç) It's time to move on to the next important music theory concept: <strong>C H O R D S</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Music theory can get quite deep, but for our purposes the most important and deepest concept we're going to cover is "harmony".  Harmony is basically the art/science of how different notes sound when they are played at the same time.  Put another way, melody is the art of stringing notes together... harmony is the art of stacking them.
  </p>
  <p>
    The good news: If you're fairly comfortable with major/minor scales and can use the circle of 5ths to figure out what sharps or flats go into a scale you are well on your way to knowing how to build chords.
  </p>

    <h2>Your Task:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>MusicTheory.net - INTERVALS
        <ul>
          <li>intervals are literally the building blocks of chords.</li>
          <li>Go through <a href="http://www.musictheory.net/lessons/30">This</a> AND <a href="http://www.musictheory.net/lessons/31">this</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>MusicTheory.net - CHORDS
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://www.musictheory.net/lessons/40">heeere we goooooo</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://www.musictheory.net/lessons/43">And one more... üòç</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>One more thing... don't stress <em>too</em> much about committing all of these rules to memory.  You need to understand how it works, for sure, but most of the time, when you are actually writing music, you will not need to remember the exact formulas of the chords so long as you know what key you're in and what notes are in the scale... more on that later.</p>
