  <h1>LESSON 2 - the keyboard.</h1>
  <h3>step one: the piano keyboard</h3>
  <p>go to this site: <a href="http://www.musictheory.net/exercises/keyboard">musictheory.net</a> and test your knowledge of the piano keyboard.</p>
  <p>if you need help, you can find a diagram <a href="http://www.piano-keyboard-guide.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/36-key-keyboard-chart.jpg">here</a></p>
  <h3>step two: the Renoise keyboard</h3>
  <p>the Renoise sequencer has all the notes of a piano keyboard mapped out to your computer keyboard like in the following diagram:</p>

  <p>Once you're fairly comfortable with the piano keyboard (musictheory.net as in, you can identify the notes with 95% accuracy or so) go ahead and experiment with putting notes into the renoise sequencer.  To do this you'll need to load up an instrument that plays notes (i.e. NOT drums).</p>
  <p>Instruments can be loaded just like the drum samples were.. find an instrument on the "instrument tab" and either double-click it or drag it up to the instrument list in the top right of the program window.</p>
