  <h1>Project 3</h1>
  <h2>here we go.....</h2>
  <p>If you've completed the previous two assignments you should already have a song begun with the following: A selection of instruments and a form framework.  Essentially all you have to do now is fill it out!</p>
  <p>In the previous assignment you should have more or less copied the form of a different song.  This does not mean that you should try to copy the actual notes and patterns of the song.  You <em>should</em>, however consider the way the sections work together... does the song change intensity between sections at all?  Is one of the sections a "build-up"? questions like these can be used to formulate an idea of what your song is supposed to do.</p>

  <p>I don't want to be too perscriptive with how you approach your song.  I don't care if you start with the drums, or the chords or whatever.  I will say, though that you'll find it easiest to start with one of the main sections (i.e. not the intro) and try to at least get a good sketch of the entire section before moving on.</p>
  <p>This is a long and involved project, so I expect it will take quite a bit of time to complete.  Try not to get bogged down on small details until the whole song form is filled out.</p>
