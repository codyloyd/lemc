  <h1>Assignment 8 - Form</h1>
  <p>For this assignment, you will email me your completed project file.</p>
  <ol>
    <h2>You're going to write me 2 simple song outlines that follow the guidelines below:</h2>
    <li>Write for 2 instruments only:
      <ul>
        <li>a piano/keyboard type instrument for playing chords</li>
        <li>any other instrument for playing the melody (can be another keyboard or piano)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>keep the chord instrument simple (i.e. just play each chord once and let it ring.. don't do fancy rhythms or arpeggiations)</li>
    <li>each section should be 32 lines long (go ahead and change the pattern length in renoise so that each section of the form is 1 pattern)... and each song will be 4 patterns</li>
    <li>the form of the first outline should be <strong>a a b a</strong></li>
    <li>the form of the second should be <strong>a b a c</strong></li>
    <li>put each song in a different key</li>
    <li>if you must.. you may drop a drum loop in for each song, but don't waste time trying to create the perfect beat, that's not the focus of this assignment.</li>
  </ol>
