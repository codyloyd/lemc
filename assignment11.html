  <h1>Assignment 11 - Form Part 2</h1>
  <ol>
    <p>For this assignment you're going to craft the form of the song you started in the last assignment.  It is not usually necessary to begin song projects by diagramming the form, but in this case it's going to help you because breaking things down like this forces you to think one step at a time.. and the constraints we're creating (by selecting the instruments and setting the FORM) will actually help you to be MORE creative in the long run.</p>
    <li>
      Open up the song you created in Assignment 10.
    </li>
    <li>Pick one of the songs you diagrammed in Lesson 11 and set up the patterns in YOUR song by following the form of the song you've selected.  </li>
    <li>in the pattern arranger window label the main and internal sections so that you can keep track of everything when you actually begin writing the song.</li>
    <li>Do NOT worry about making everything identical, or about making every section the exact same length as in the original song... in fact, the form may change a bit as you begin actually writing the song, and that's O.K.</li>
    <li>As a bit of a guideline: all of your Main sections should be at LEAST 2 patterns long.</li> 
  </ol>
