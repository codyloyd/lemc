  <h1>Lesson 4 - Basic Audio Effects</h1>
  <p>When writing music in Renoise you are not limited to the pre-programmed sounds that come with the program.  In fact, you have the ability to craft an infinite number of sounds by adding effects.</p>
  <p>This lesson is going to cover a few of the most commonly used effects.  Download this project file: <a href="./files/lesson4.xrns">Lesson 4</a> <br>
  This lesson file is one pattern with many tracks... for the most part, each track has the same music, but with different effects added to change the sound.  Follow along with the lesson by "soloing" each track in turn so you can hear and play with the effects. <br>
  The first track is the melody with no effects added.  I intentionally selected a very simple instrument for this example so you can more clearly hear what each effect is doing to the sound. Listen to it now.
  </p>

    <h3>DELAY</h3>
  <p>
    Our first effect is "delay".  Delay is a simple effect that can be thought of as an "Echo" it simply repeats a sound again at a later time. <br>
    Track 2 has our melody with a simple delay added.  Go ahead and listen to it now. <br>
    Most effects come with a few decent-sounding presets, so go ahead and play with those now to see the wide variety of sounds that you can get with this simple effect.
  </p>

  <p>
    A comprehensive explanation of all the features can be found here: <a href="http://tutorials.renoise.com/wiki/Audio_Effects#Delay">Renoise Manual - Delay</a>. <br>
    You don't need to read it all right now, but do look at the sections for "Line Sync" and "Feedback".  These are the most important settings at the moment. <br>
    Before moving on, take a moment to play around with the effect to see what kind of sounds you can create. ðŸ˜Š
  </p>

  <h3>Reverb</h3>
  <p>Reverb is intended to simulate the "reverberations" of a sound that is played in an actual room and is used extensively in many different contexts.  Get familiar with the sound now by listening to tracks 3 and 4.</p>
  <p>As before, play with the presets and experiment with the settings to see the kinds of sounds you can get with this effect. <br>
  Refer to the <a href="http://tutorials.renoise.com/wiki/Audio_Effects#Reverb">Renoise Documentation</a> to see what the settings each do.</p>

  <h3>DISTORTION</h3>
  <p>Distortion is another common effect that is used to add "noise" to a sound.  It can be used either subtly (adding a small amount of color to the sound) or heavily (completely destroying the sound)</p>
  <p>your options here are, again, fairly straightforward.  Checkout the <a href="http://tutorials.renoise.com/wiki/Audio_Effects#Distortion">DOCS</a> and experiment briefly before moving on.</p>

  <h3>Combining Effects</h3>
  <p>A very wide range of sounds can be created by chaining together many effects on each track.  Go through the remaining tracks in the project and look at the effects to see how each sound was created.  Feel free to experiment with the effects to change the sounds.</p>
