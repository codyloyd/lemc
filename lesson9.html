    As I've mentioned before, Mixing is the art of tweaking the sound of the track by adjusting the levels of the tracks so that they sound great together.  Mixing can also include adding effects such as EQ, Reverb or Compression to change how each track fits into the Mix.

    One of the more important effects for achieving a good mix in your music is the compressor.  Unfortunately, compressors are not necessarily the simplest effect.  It can be hard to tell exactly what's happening to the track as you add a compressor, and tweak the settings.

    This video explains the most important functions of a compressor quite well.
