  <h1>Assignment 10 - PLUGINS</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Most of your songs will end up using a combination of renoise instruments and effects and third-party plugins.... so this assignment is to find a nice set of sounds to use for the next project. Do not email me this assignment... just let me know when you're done and I'll come see what you've got.</li>

  <li>The next project is going to be a longer song with a more involved form.  To make the process of writing that song easier we're going to break it down a little bit over the next couple of lessons.</li>
  <li>For this song pick out the following (in whatever order you like... sometimes I'll start with the drums, sometimes I'll start with the melody or bass.. it doesn't matter)
    <ol>
      <li>Drums (kick, hats (open and closed.. it's nice to have variation)  snare and/or clap and anything else you might like.</li>
      <li>Bass (pick one or two sounds..)</li>
      <li>PAD (some sort of slow sound for sustaining chords)</li>
      <li>Melodic Sounds (pick 2-4 sounds) can be a sustained lead sound, a keyboard sound or anything else you might like</li>
      <li>be sure to use at least 2 VSTs!</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Do not start writing out the song yet.... but it might be helpful for you to play around with the sounds to see if they sound nice together.. so it's OK if you make a little drum beat and/or bassline so you can get a feel for things as you pick out the rest of the instruments.</li>
  <li>Your main goal is to pick out sounds that you like, that you think will sound nice together.  You will likely want to change your sounds and/or add something later and that's fine.. but let's get a good start now.</li>
  </ol>
