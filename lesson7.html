  <h1>Lesson 7 - Chord Progressions</h1>
  <p>
    As you have no doubt discovered.. certain arrangements of chords sound better than others.. and regardless of whether or not a progression sounds "GOOD" or "BAD", different progressions create different feelings.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Even using the same chords but changing the order, or changing the rhythm (i.e. how long each chord lasts) can have a significant effect on how a song feels.  This lesson doesn't have much new information, instead it involves you playing around with chord progressions to get a feel for what types of sounds you like in your music.
  </p>
  <p>
    Enter <a href="https://www.hooktheory.com/hookpad/new">HOOKPAD</a>.  Hookpad makes it easy to play around and experiment with chords and do things like change the key or swap out chords on the fly.
  </p>
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>go to the hookpad website (<a href="https://www.hooktheory.com/hookpad/new">linky-link</a>) and spend about 15 minutes playing around with the tool.  See how many cool sounding progressions you can create</li>
      <li>Either create a new progression (or use one you already made in the previous step) and see if you can translate the chords in hookpad into Renoise.
        <ul>
          <li>
            To do this successfully keep track of the Key you are in, then just spell out the chords using the notes from the correct scale.  
          </li>
          <li>
            You shouldn't <em>need</em> to worry too much about whether the chords are major or minor so long as you keep to the Key that you're writing in... it should just work out. (for now)
          </li>
          <li>
            If you can manage this, you are ready to move on to the assignment......
