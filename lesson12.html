  <h1>Lesson 12 - EXPRESSSSSIVITITY</h1>
  <p>Most people agree that emotionally expressive music is the best music.  HOWEVER: in many cases electronic music can turn out to be rather dry and bland because of the rigid programmed nature of it.  This lesson is going to discuss a few techniques for making your electronic music a little more expressive.</p>
  <h2>Main Idea => make stuff move!</h2>
  <p>In most cases, evolving sounds are going to be judged as more expressive than static sounds so these techniques are going to be based upon making sounds that change over time.</p>

    <h2>Velocity</h2>
    In the realm of music production, velocity is the volume and intensity of a note.  It is simply a setting that can be manipulated in Renoise for every note.  The effect that changing velocity has on a note depends upon how the instrument is set up... some instruments are <em>very</em> sensitive to velocity, while others are less so.
  </p>
  <p>Watch this video to see an example of sounds changing via velocity, and how to do it in renoise. <br>
