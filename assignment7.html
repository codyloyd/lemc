  <h1>Assignment 7 - HookPad & Chord Progressions</h1>
  <p>For this assignment, you will email me your completed project file.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Go to hookpad and create an <strong>AMAZING ðŸ”¥</strong> chord progression in the key of your choosing.</li>
    <li>In renoise, write 2 songs(64 lines, drums and chords only) using the SAME chord progression.. trying to make the songs as different as possible (different instruments, different beat etc.)</li>
    <li>On both songs add a bass that plays the root of each chord</li>
    <li>On both songs try to add a melody that sounds nice with the chords (use primarily chord tones for the melody).</li>
    <li><strong>SAVE</strong> and email me the completed assignment. (might be best if this one was 2 separate files)</li>
  </ol>
