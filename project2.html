  <h1>Project 2</h1>
  <p>Compose a song within the following guidelines.
  <ol>
    <h2>project guidelines:</h2>
    <li>Feel completely free to add as many other tracks as needed, but your song should at least have these 7 tracks:
        <ol>
          <li>Kick Drum</li>
          <li>Snare Drum</li>
          <li>Hi Hat</li>
          <li>Melody</li>
          <li>Secondary Melody</li>
          <li>Chords</li>
          <li>Bass</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The 2 melody tracks do not need to play at the same time... they can be used in different parts of the song.</li>
    <li>your song should contain 2 main sections melodies, each of which is 64 or 128 lines long (the sections can be 1 or 2 patterns long)</li>
    <li>YOU select the tempo</li>
    <li>use effects to enhance the sound.</li>
    <li>the drum beat is up to you, but make sure it is cohesive by placing snare hits on beats 2 and 4</li>
    <li>arrange your song so that it loops between the sections nicely.. i.e. feel free to repeat the main sections a time or two so that it's not switching between the sections too quickly.</li>
    <li>the 2 sections should be noticibly contrasting, so do any (or all) of the following to distinguish them:
      <ul>
        <li>change drum beat</li>
        <li>change melody</li>
        <li>change the instruments</li>
        <li>change the length of the pattern</li>
        <li>change the chords</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>the sections MUST be in the same key.. but do not have to use the same chords.</li>
    <li>arrange your two sections into a song by AT LEAST going back to the first section after playing the second.</li>
    <li>feel free to add variations to the sectons when they repeat.</li>
    <li>feel free to create a little  "intro" and "outro" for your song.</li>
  </ol>
