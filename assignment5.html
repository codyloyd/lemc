  <h1>Assignment 5 - Basic Mixing and Track Grouping</h1>
  <p>For this assignment, you will email me your completed project file.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>You are going to write 4 single pattern "songs" with drums (kick,hat,snare) and at least 2 melodic voices.  For best results make the melodic voices very contrasting.. for example if one of them has lots of fast notes, the other one should have sparse notes.  If one of them is mostly high notes, the other should be lower etc.</li>
    <li>In each song, group the drums and the melodic tracks and then mix them separately before mixing them together.</li>
    <li>Use effects!</li>
    <li>Write each song in a different key. (you pick!)</li>
  </ol>
