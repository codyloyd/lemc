    <li>
      Do your best to mix this song.. I've intentionally made it a little bit messy (i.e. there's too much going on) to give you a bit of a challenge
    </li>
    <li>
      Group related tracks together (feel free to move tracks around) and mix them separately before trying to mix the whole song.
    </li>
    <li>Make sure that no tracks are clipping</li>
    <li>USE A COMPRESSOR.  You don't need it on every track, but use one at least 4 times.  Hint: you might want to put a compressor on an individial track, AND the group that the track belongs to. AAAAAND maybe the master as well.</li>
    <li>Use as many other effects as you feel you need (EQ/REVERB/FILTER/etc.)</li>
  </ol>
