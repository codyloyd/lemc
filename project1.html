  <h1>Project 1</h1>
  <p>For your first Project, you are going to compose a <em>SHORT</em> song.  It's best to start simply when learning these types of things, so this project is going to be very simple.  It is important that you try not to overcomplicate things at this point.</p>
  <p>Your song should follow the guidelines at the bottom of the page.  Do not try to embellish or add things yet.. just do what is called for.</p>
  <ol>
    <h2>project guidelines:</h2>
    <li>Your song should have exactly 4 tracks:
        <ol>
          <li>Kick Drum</li>
          <li>Snare Drum</li>
          <li>Hi Hat</li>
          <li>Melody</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>You may select any instrument you like for the "melody" track so long as it plays a clear pitch (don't pick something too noisy or distorted)</li>
    <li>your song should contain 2 patterns, each of which is 64 lines long</li>
    <li>YOU select the tempo</li>
    <li>the drum beat is up to you, but make sure it is cohesive by placing snare hits on beats 2 and 4</li>
    <li>for the melody, you are ONLY allowed to use the following pitches: A C E F G (in any octave)</li>
    <li>your melody notes may ONLY fall on even numbered lines (i.e. they're 8th notes) but feel free to vary the rhythm to make it more interesting.</li>
    <li>for an example of what I'm looking for check out this file: <a href="./files/project1sample.xrns"></a></li>
    <li>IMPORTANT: Don't just poke notes in at random.. really try to make the melody sound nice.  Good luck!</li>
    <li>Email me the finished project when you complete it.</li>
  </ol>
